# üêª Cubstart Web: Spring 2025

_Every Thursday from 7pm to 9pm in [Soda 306](https://coeesg.wpengine.com/av-facilities-and-services-by-room/soda306/)._

Cubstart is a Decal offered by Hackathons @ Berkeley (the team behind Cal Hacks). It's an introduction to building fullstack web applications. By the end of the course, you'll:

* Be able to ship real-world projects.
* Have experience with a range of technologies, both frontend and backend.
* Be able to take initiative as a developer.
* Feel comfortable debugging on your own.

## Structure

This class will meet once a week every Thursday. Each session will have a different theme (see below for the calendar). After a brief introduction lecture, each student will work on a project of their own. For example, for our first session, every student will make their own personal website. At the end of each session, students will share what they've made with their peers and course staff.

The last four weeks will be dedicated to your final project, which is ideating and building a viable product/application. You‚Äôll work with a team or alone; we will be offering office hours support along the way. Besides the final project, there'll be no homework for this semester.

## Requirements

We do not enforce prerequisites, but prior coding experience of any kind is recommended (high school course, CS10, CS61A, etc).

Students should come to the first session of class w/ an IDE (we recommend VSCode), Node.js, and GitHub Desktop installed.

Above all, bring positivity and curiosity to class! The more you give to the class, the more you'll get out of it.
